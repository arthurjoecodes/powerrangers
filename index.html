Power Rangers Samurai is the eighteenth season of the American children's television series Power Rangers, which is based on the Japanese Super Sentai Series.[1] The season was the first to be produced by SCG Power Rangers, after Saban Brands (a successor to the original production company, Saban Entertainment) acquired the franchise, and it the first to use the "Saban" name since the first half of Power Rangers: Wild Force. The season marks the franchise's debut on Nickelodeon, premiering on the main network and Nicktoons on February 7, 2011.[2]
Samurai uses props and footage from Samurai Sentai Shinkenger and, according to press material, had a "brighter tone and an infusion of fun and comedy that wasn't present in seasons 16 and 17."[3] Samurai is also the first season to be shot and broadcast in HD. Though 2006's Boukenger (which was adapted into Operation Overdrive) was the first Super Sentai series to be shot in HD, preceding Power Rangers seasons weren't. Samurai also returns the series to a multi-seasonal format; the second season, titled Power Rangers Super Samurai, began on February 18, 2012 and is officially considered the nineteenth season overall.[4][5][6]

Saban announced they would be enacting an "aggressive" multimedia focus, with planned apps, games, streaming content, and social media content in addition to live shows and a feature film.[3][7] The run-up to the new series was promoted by 145 Days of Power Rangers, a daily airing of every Mighty Morphin episode in order. An official Power Rangers Facebook page was also created.[8]
On November 24, 2010, the Power Rangers website placed a trailer for the show online, hosted on Yahoo! Kids. The new Samurai Rangers also appeared at the 2010 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.[9]
Paul Schrier has a recurring role in the season, reprising his role as Bulk originating from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.[10] Jason Narvy subsequently reprised his role as Skull in the final episode.
For the second batch of episodes airing in 2012, Saban began promoting the season with the title of "Super Samurai" to reflect the upgrades to the Rangers powers (glimpsed already in "Clash of the Red Rangers The Movie"). Actor Hector David, Jr.
