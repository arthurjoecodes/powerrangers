<h3><em><strong>Power Rangers Samurai 1.</strong></em></h3>  
<p>
<em>
Power Rangers Samurai is the eighteenth season of the American children's television series Power Rangers, which is based on the Japanese Super Sentai Series. The season was the first to be produced by SCG Power Rangers, after Saban Brands (a successor to the original production company, Saban Entertainment) acquired the franchise, and it the first to use the "Saban" name since the first half of Power Rangers: Wild Force. The season marks the franchise's debut on Nickelodeon, premiering on the main network and Nicktoons on February 7, 2011.
Samurai uses props and footage from Samurai Sentai Shinkenger and, according to press material, had a "brighter tone and an infusion of fun and comedy that wasn't present in seasons 16 and 17. Samurai is also the first season to be shot and broadcast in HD.

Saban announced they would be enacting an "aggressive" multimedia focus, with planned apps, games, streaming content, and social media content in addition to live shows and a feature film. The run-up to the new series was promoted by 145 Days of Power Rangers, a daily airing of every Mighty Morphin episode in order. An official Power Rangers Facebook page was also created.
